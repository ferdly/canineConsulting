[bug] cannot edit existing country only address
once I added an address crap and new got Ids
changed tag from UNTAGGED to MAIN it got an ID
Â¿when 'touched' as Contact it gets an ID?
Formatted is auto-magic in WiX, no need to work at it.
apt, I _think_ just there for WiX, empty, but there
<---------->
my guess is that _nothing_ in member gets changed when contact gets changed
